The website

## To run

Hugo is a golang project! If you don't have go, install it here according to your system specs:

[hugo installatin instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

## Local server 

To start the local development server with live reloading:

```
hugo serve -D
```

The `-D` parameter means it will include "draft" pages. It is kind of optional but good to include.
