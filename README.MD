# Data Dancers Website

The website

## Requirements

This site runs with Hugo, a golang project! If you don't have go, install it here according to your system specs:

[hugo installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

```sh
# macos
brew install hugo
```

## Local server

To start the local development server with live reloading:

```
hugo serve -D
```

The `-D` parameter means it will include "draft" pages. It is kind of optional but good to include.
