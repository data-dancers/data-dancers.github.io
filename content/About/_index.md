Welcome to Data Dancers, an Atlanta based live coding collective founded in 2023.

We perform at algoraves and collaborate on various creative projects blending code with artistic expression. Meeting monthly, we collaborate with a diverse array of artists, musicians, programmers, hackers, and writers, combining these disciplines in creative ways.

Our collective is inclusive and open to everyone, regardless of experience. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just curious, we invite you to join us. Connect with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xs5ztf6THf) for more details, and visit our [Meetup page](https://data-dancers.github.io/meetups/) for information on upcoming meetups.
